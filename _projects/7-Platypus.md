 ![image-center](/images/platypus1.jpg){: .align-left width="330px"} How can we continuously monitor the development of miniature cracks in today's aging public infrastructure like bridges? This would inform decisions on safety and maintenance of these critical structures well in advance. Past work has looked at coarse grained structure health monitoring. Platypus builds novel signal processing and low power hardware tags to mount on bridges. We enable a new operating point that can measure micro-displacements of structures over years and in extreme weather conditions.
