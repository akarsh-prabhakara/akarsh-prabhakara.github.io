 ![image-center](/images/quasar_sq.jpg){: .align-right width="280px"} Low Earth Orbit cubesats and nanosats satellites have paved the way for missions with cheaper launch costs. But, ground infrastructure for communication remains bulky and expensive. Quasar proposes to alleviate this problem by democratizing access to satellite transmissions at the cost of a few RTL-SDRs. The key idea behind Quasar is to leverage a network of cheap radios to mimic one single expensive radio. Quasar achieves this by tackling challenges with respect to synchronizing the cheap radios, dealing with high doppler spread and central aggregation of high bandwidth raw radio streams.
