 ![image-center](/images/zoomout.jpg){: .align-right width="260px"} As more and more edge computational tasks are performed at an embedded, chip-scale radar, we need accelerators that not only deal with signal processing blocks at Gbps datarates, but also adapt to the rising benefits of machine learning. Zoom Out proposes novel abstractions to map machine learning models from high level language to accelerators for easy and efficient implementations.
