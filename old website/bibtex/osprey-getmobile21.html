    abstract = {Tire wear is a leading cause of accidents. Tire wear is measured either manually, or by embedding sensors in tires, or using off-tire sensors. Manual sensing is extremely tedious. Sensors embedded in tire treads are challenging to design and expensive to embed. Off-tire sensors like laser range finders are prone to debris that may settle in grooves. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a mmWave radar based tire wear sensor, which is easy to install, and continuously provides accurate and robust tire wear measurements even in the presence of debris.},
