I am a Ph.D. candidate in ECE at Carnegie Mellon University. I am coadvised by [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr) and [Prof. Swarun Kumar](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/swarunk/index.html). My current research interests broadly lie in cyber-physical systems. In my graduate research, I build systems that use millimeter wave radio frequencies to better sense the world around us.

Prior to CMU, I spent 4 wonderful years doing my undergrad at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), India.
