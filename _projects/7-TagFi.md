 ![image-center](/images/tagfi_sq.jpg){: .align-left width="260px"} How can we locate important and often misplaced objects-of-interest like keys, wallets, tools? Prior works that involve buildings tags for objects either need supporting custom infrastructure or the tags are power hungry for multi-year timescales. We turn to already existing and widely deployed WiFi networks for infrastructure support and build custom extremely low power tags. The user can simply forget about the tag for years. Our algorithms can locate tags (objects) with fine-grained accuracy and provide seamless context awareness with just unmodified WiFi.
