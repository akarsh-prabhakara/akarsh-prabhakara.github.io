 ![image-center](/images/metamorph.png){: .align-left width="260px"} Can inflatable robots enhance wireless communication? We show that by placing an array of shape-morphing inflatable robots near an antenna we can boost the signal quality received at the antenna. Our methodology is best suited for base stations that need to adapt to slow moving changes --- such as seasonal effects. For a Low-Power Wide Area Network link, we show that deploying this at the gateway can have significant improvements to signal quality and yields huge battery savings.
