I am an assistant professor in CS and affiliated with ECE at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

My research interests broadly lie in wireless systems and cyber-physical systems. My goal is to build wireless systems that perceive and communicate with high fidelity unlocking new application potentials. Currently, I am interested in the following themes:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
1. *Machine Learning driven radio frequency systems* ([CVPR 24](/files/dart-cvpr24.pdf), [ICRA 23](/files/radarhd-icra23.pdf))
2. *Wireless for robust autonomous systems* ([IROS 22](/files/metamoran-iros22.pdf), [MobiCom 21](/files/millimetro-mobicom21.pdf))
3. *New paradigms in communication systems* ([MobiCom 24](/files/hydra-mobicom24.pdf), [MobiCom 21](/files/quasar-mobicom21.pdf))
4. *Novel embedded applications of wireless signals* ([MobiSys 20](/files/osprey-mobisys20.pdf), [UbiComp 21](/files/tagfi-ubicomp21.pdf), [IPSN 23](/files/platypus-ipsn23.pdf))

I am actively hiring Ph.D. students. If these or allied topics seem interesting to you, please shoot me an email!

<!-- I have built systems that use millimeter wave radio frequencies for realizing key applications in transportation, robotics, critical infrastructure monitoring and pushing the limits of wireless communication.

<!-- My work has won Best Paper Honorable Mention and in the spirit of demonstrable systems research, Best Demo and Demo Runner-Up as well. My research was also featured in [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/researchers-find-that-radar-can-be-used-to-detect-a-nai-1844635816) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/researchers-develop-system-that-monitors-tire-wear-in-real-time-4ff4d9c738f3) to name a few. One of my notable impacts is in transferring our academic work to an interested global company, Bridgestone Inc.
