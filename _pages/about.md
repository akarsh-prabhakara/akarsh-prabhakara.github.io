I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) since 2025. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/). Previously, I went to [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) for my Ph.D. where I worked with Prof. [Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/) and Prof. [Swarun Kumar](https://swarunkumar.com/).

My research interests broadly lie in wireless systems and cyber-physical systems. My goal is to build wireless systems that perceive and communicate with high fidelity unlocking new application potentials. 

In pursuit of this vision, we have built systems along the following themes:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
1. *Machine Learning driven radio frequency systems* ([ICCV 25](/), [CVPR 24](/files/dart-cvpr24.pdf), [ICRA 23](/files/radarhd-icra23.pdf))
2. *New paradigms in communication systems* ([MobiCom 24](/files/hydra-mobicom24.pdf), [MobiCom 21](/files/millimetro-mobicom21.pdf), [MobiCom 21](/files/quasar-mobicom21.pdf))
3. *Wireless + Robotics* ([ICRA 25](/files/metamorph-icra25.pdf), [Sci Ro 24](/files/avatars-scirobotics24.pdf), [IROS 22](/files/metamoran-iros22.pdf))
4. *Embedded applications of wireless signals* ([MobiSys 20](/files/osprey-mobisys20.pdf), [UbiComp 21](/files/tagfi-ubicomp21.pdf), [IPSN 23](/files/platypus-ipsn23.pdf))

<!-- I have built systems that use millimeter wave radio frequencies for realizing key applications in transportation, robotics, critical infrastructure monitoring and pushing the limits of wireless communication.

<!-- My work has won Best Paper Honorable Mention and in the spirit of demonstrable systems research, Best Demo and Demo Runner-Up as well. My research was also featured in [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/researchers-find-that-radar-can-be-used-to-detect-a-nai-1844635816) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/researchers-develop-system-that-monitors-tire-wear-in-real-time-4ff4d9c738f3) to name a few. One of my notable impacts is in transferring our academic work to an interested global company, Bridgestone Inc.
