 ![image-center](/images/avatars.jpg){: .align-right width="260px"} How can we maximize rendezvous opportunities for autonomous robots with sperm whales? We propose an autonomy and sensing module to this end. The sensing module on a drone performs a VHF synthetic aperture radar based whale positioning when the whale surfaces and uses underwater acoustic sensors to track whales under water. Using the sensing module's data, we build a reinforcement learning algorithm that plans where autonomous robots should be dispatched to maximize chances of whale rendezvous.
