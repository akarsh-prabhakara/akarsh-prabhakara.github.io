I am a Ph.D. candidate in ECE at Carnegie Mellon University. I am coadvised by [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr) and [Prof. Swarun Kumar](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/swarunk/index.html). 

My research interests broadly lie in wireless systems and cyber-physical systems. My research makes advances in wireless systems to enhance radio frequency sensing for cyber-physical systems that operate in harsh conditions and enable next generation communication.

1. *Next-gen Cyber-Physical Systems*: Think of self-driving cars in fog and robots in smoke.
2. *Next-gen Communication*: Think of ultra-aware reconfigurable radio surfaces and devices.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I have built systems that use millimeter wave radio frequencies for realizing key applications in transportation, robotics, critical infrastructure monitoring and wireless communication.

My work has won Best Paper Honorable Mention and in the spirit of demonstrable systems research, Best Demo and Demo Runner-Up as well. My research was also featured in [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/researchers-find-that-radar-can-be-used-to-detect-a-nai-1844635816) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/researchers-develop-system-that-monitors-tire-wear-in-real-time-4ff4d9c738f3) to name a few. One of my notable impacts is in transferring our academic work to an interested global company, Bridgestone Inc.

I am on the job market this cycle!

Have a look at my [CV](/files/CV.pdf), [research](/files/research_statement.pdf), [teaching](/files/teaching_statement.pdf) and [diversity](/files/diversity_statement.pdf) statements and please reach out to me if you are interested.
