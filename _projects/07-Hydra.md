 ![image-center](/images/hydra_sq.jpg){: .align-left width="260px"} Conventional radar processing only allows estimating the spatial locations of objects in the incident field of view. But, in practice, the radio waves bounce off objects in the field of view and illuminate hidden objects. Can we leverage this multi-bouce effect and image scenes beyond the field of view of a typical mmWave radar? We propose algorithms that can tackle double and triple bounces to expand the field of view to even diametrically opposite to the incident beam!
