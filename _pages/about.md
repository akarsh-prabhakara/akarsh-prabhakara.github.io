I am a Ph.D. student in ECE at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests broadly lie in wireless systems. I am coadvised by [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr) and [Prof. Swarun Kumar](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/swarunk/index.html).

Prior to CMU, I spent 4 wonderful years doing my undergrad at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), Surathkal, India.
